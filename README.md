# Oloche's AI Oncologist: Breast Cancer Detector

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning system for breast cancer classification using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. The system analyzes diagnostic measurements to classify tumors as either malignant or benign with high accuracy. The model is deployed as an interactive web application using Gradio and Hugging Face Spaces.

## Findings
Top Predictive Features: The most important features for classification are:

Worst concave points

Worst perimeter

Mean concave points

Worst radius

Worst area

Class Imbalance Impact: Addressing class imbalance improved recall for malignant cases without sacrificing overall accuracy.

Model Robustness: Cross-validation confirmed model stability with consistent performance across different data splits.

ðŸŽ® Using the Web Interface
The Gradio interface provides an intuitive way to interact with the model:

Input Methods:

Manually enter 30 tumor characteristic values

Use "Load Default" for average values

Use "Malignant Example" or "Benign Example" for sample cases

Use "Clear All" to reset inputs

Output Features:

Clear diagnosis (Benign/Malignant)

Confidence percentage

Probability analysis for both classes

Risk assessment level

Personalized medical advice

Visual Elements:

Color-coded diagnosis badges

Confidence meter visualization

Detailed JSON results
